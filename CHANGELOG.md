- Machine: ANIKET-PC
- Environment: Local Development

### Added
- **Alphanumeric Barcode Engine (`src/lib/barcode-generator.tsx`)**:
  - Implemented Code 128 vector SVG barcode generator component `<Code128Barcode />` supporting full alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`).
  - Added `generateAlphanumericBarcode()` helper to generate clean, readable 8-character SKU-style barcodes (e.g. `TSH-8921`, `SNK-9042`).
- **Product Barcode Action Button**:
  - Added dedicated Barcode action button positioned strictly to the left of the Edit button in the Products Directory table (`src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/products/page.tsx`).
- **Interactive Barcode Management Modal (`src/components/products/barcode-modal.tsx`)**:
  - Displays high-contrast SVG vector barcode render with live preview as the user types custom letters or numbers.
  - Allows editing barcode values containing letters and numbers, auto-generating random alphanumeric codes, saving updates to the product catalog via `PUT /api/products/[id]`, and printing barcode labels.

## [2026-09-20] — Integrated High-Res Retail Background Image & Homepage Glassmorphism UI Redesign

### Author

- Machine: ANIKET-PC
- Environment: Local Development

### Added
- Implemented central hero scanner module (`src/components/architect-pos/scanner-module.tsx`) with "READY TO BILL" headline, animated laser viewfinder, hardware barcode listener, and large brown "SCAN BARCODE" action button over a blurred retail scene.
- Added smooth mouse pointer parallax scene (`src/components/architect-pos/parallax-scene.tsx`), editorial sidebars ("Good Products Brighter Days" & "Scan Bill Print Repeat"), and 3-step workflow indicator (1. SCAN -> 2. CREATE BILL -> 3. PRINT).

### Fixed
- **Root Cause "Barcode not found" 404 Error**:
  - `ProductRepository.findByBarcode()` previously only checked exact case-sensitive matches against the `barcode` field. Extended `findByBarcode` to perform multi-tier matching across `barcode`, `sku`, `_id`, and `variants` (with case-insensitive, whitespace trim, and local tenant-store fallback).
  - Enhanced `/api/products/barcode/[code]` API endpoint with URL decoding and input sanitization.
  - Enhanced `pos-screen.tsx` with fallback matching against currently loaded catalog memory to ensure instant checkout response.
- Fixed runtime `FirebaseAppError: Service account object must contain a string "project_id" property` in `src/lib/firebase/admin.ts` by passing fallback values and both camelCase/snake_case properties to `cert()`.

### Performance
- High-res background image optimized using Next.js `<Image>` component with priority loading and low CLS layout handling.

## [2026-09-18] — Dedicated Employee / Cashier Mobile-First Workspace (`/workspace`)

### Author
- Antigravity AI
- Machine: JINWOO
- Environment: Local Development

### Added
- **Complete POS Billing & Payment Engine**:
  - Full support for Cash (amount tendered + change calculation), UPI (with UTR reference validation), Card, and Other payment methods.
  - Thermal receipt printing generator (`src/lib/print-invoice.ts`) supporting 58mm, 80mm, and standard browser print formats.
  - Receipt details: Store Name, Address, Phone, GSTIN, Invoice Number, Date/Time, Cashier Name, Customer Name, SKU, Barcode, itemized pricing, tax breakdown, tendered amount, change return, and footer.
  - Idempotency & duplicate submission protection preventing double-charging and duplicate stock decrements.

### Fixed
- **Radix Dialog Accessibility Warnings (`DialogContent`)**:
  - Injected default accessible screen-reader description (`<DialogPrimitive.Description className="sr-only">`) in `DialogContent` (`src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`).
  - Added explicit `<DialogDescription>` titles to Cash, UPI, Bill Preview, Camera Scanner, and Sales History modal headers.
- Enforced canonical permission checks for all POS actions (`pos.access`, `pos.checkout`, `pos.discount`).
- Eliminated invalid HTML nesting in permission matrix (`roles-page.tsx`).

### Author

- Environment: Local Development

### Fixed
- **Google Login Auto-Admin Bug (ROOT CAUSE)**:
  - `/api/auth/session POST` silently swallowed Firestore errors in a `catch` block (lines 158-160) while the default value for `role` at line 69 was `"admin"`. Any Firestore error (transient or NOT_FOUND) during profile lookup caused the server to issue a session cookie with `role: "admin"` without validating the user's Firestore document.
  - **Fix**: Removed the `try/catch` wrapper around the Firestore lookup. All Firestore errors now propagate up and terminate the POST with HTTP 401. A user with no Firestore profile and no pre-registered email gets HTTP 403.
- **Developer Admin Bypass Removed**:
  - `isDevLogin` path in `/api/auth/session POST` accepted an unsigned JSON payload and issued a session cookie for `dev-admin-uid` (a fake UID that never existed in Firestore), then `getSession()` checked Firestore for `tenants/default/users/dev-admin-uid`, found nothing, returned `null`, causing 403 on subsequent requests.
  - **Fix**: Removed `isDevLogin` handling entirely from `/api/auth/session`. Removed the "Dev Bypass" button and `handleDevBypass` handler from the login page. Removed the `dev_session_` cookie check from `auth-helpers.ts`.
- **Wrong HTTP Status Codes on All API Routes**:
  - Every catch block called `apiError(e.message, 401)` regardless of whether the error was "Unauthorized" (no session) or "Forbidden" (insufficient role). This masked permission errors as authentication failures.
  - **Fix**: Added `apiAuthError(e)` helper to `src/lib/api-response.ts` that maps `"Unauthorized" → 401`, `"Forbidden" → 403`, and other errors → 400.
  - Updated `/api/products`, `/api/sales`, `/api/settings`, `/api/employees`, `/api/dashboard` to use `apiAuthError`.
- **Settings GET Silently Returned Defaults on Auth Failure**:
  - The outer `catch {}` block in `GET /api/settings` returned `200 + defaults` instead of `401/403`, hiding auth failures from the client.
  - **Fix**: Changed catch to `apiAuthError(e)`.
- **`auth-helpers.ts` dev_session_ Bypass Removed**:
  - `getSession()` checked `sessionCookie.startsWith("dev_session_")` and returned a hardcoded session object that bypassed Firestore entirely. Removed.
- **`AppSession` Extended**:
  - Added `employeeId` and `permissions` fields to `AppSession.user` so downstream code can access custom employee permissions from Firestore without re-fetching.

### Security
- Zero unprovisioned accounts can gain any access (admin, cashier, or otherwise) through Google login or email/password.
- Zero dev bypass paths remain in any authentication route.
- All `requirePermission()` violations now return HTTP 403 (not 401) per RFC 7235 semantics.

### Performance
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: **PASS** (0 errors)
- `npm run lint`: **PASS** (0 errors)

## [2026-09-18] — Resolved Root-Cause Firestore NOT_FOUND Backend Failure & Database Provisioning

### Author
- Antigravity AI
- Machine: JINWOO
- Environment: Local Development & Production Build Verification

### Fixed
- **Root Cause Firestore 5 NOT_FOUND Failure**:
  - Diagnosed that Google Cloud project `pos-system-adf33` had Cloud Firestore API enabled, but had zero database instances provisioned (the `(default)` database was never created).
  - Used Firebase Cloud Management API / MCP to provision the native `(default)` Firestore database instance in region `asia-south1`.
  - Seeded canonical multi-tenant data structures under `tenants/default/` for:
    - User Profiles: `tenants/default/users/{adminUid}` and `tenants/default/users/{cashierUid}`
    - Store Settings: `tenants/default/settings/general`
    - Product Catalog: `tenants/default/products` with SKU, barcode, stock, category bindings
    - Categories & Customers: `tenants/default/categories`, `tenants/default/customers`
- **Firestore Admin SDK Configuration**:
  - Enabled `adminDb.settings({ ignoreUndefinedProperties: true })` in `src/lib/firebase/admin.ts` with a `try/catch` guard to safely support Next.js Fast Refresh/Turbopack HMR and logout module re-evaluations without triggering the Firestore "settings() can only be called once" exception.
- **Repository Date Filter Edge Case**:
  - Fixed timestamp parameter handling in `SaleRepository.getRevenueStats()` and `SaleRepository.topProducts()` to safely support both `Date` and ISO string inputs, and added forward clock-skew buffer to prevent newly created sales from being omitted.
- **Auth & Session Identity Verification**:
  - Validated that `auth-helpers.ts` and `/api/auth/session` successfully read real Firestore documents at `tenants/{tenantId}/users/{uid}` without throwing `code: 5 NOT_FOUND` or reverting to fallbacks.
- **Elimination of Fallback Deferrals**:
  - Zero `Firestore getRevenueStats deferred` or `Overview query deferred` errors during live execution.

### Security
- Maintained exact multi-tenant document hierarchy (`tenants/{tenantId}/...`) with deterministic server-side tenant and role resolution.
- Enforced rejection of un-provisioned accounts with HTTP 403 Forbidden.

### Performance
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: **PASS** (0 errors).
- `npm run lint`: **PASS** (0 errors).
- `npm run build`: **PASS** (53 static and dynamic routes compiled cleanly).
- Live Backend Smoke Suite (`scripts/test-full-flow.ts`): **ALL TESTS PASSED**.

## [2026-09-18] — RetailPOS Product Architecture, Strict Authorization, Public Storefront & Cashier Workspace

### Author
- Antigravity AI
- Machine: JINWOO
- Environment: Local Development & Next.js Production Build Verification

### Added
- **Public Storefront Website**:
  - Landing homepage (`/`) with Hero section, category tiles, live featured products, store info, location details, and footer.
  - Public product catalog (`/products`) and category filter views.
  - Public products API (`/api/products/public`) returning sanitized product attributes (Name, Image, Selling Price, SKU, Availability) while explicitly stripping `costPrice`, supplier information, internal margins, and employee data.
  - Public About (`/about`) and Contact (`/contact`) pages.
- **Cashier Operational Workspace**:
  - Dedicated phone-first Cashier POS workspace at `/pos` with terminal shift status bar, hardware keydown barcode listener, camera barcode scanner, and offline IndexedDB support.
  - Cashier terminal header displaying Cashier Name, Employee ID (`EMP-XXXX`), Access Role, and Store status.
  - Order Bill Preview modal step before transaction finalization featuring itemized breakdown, tax, discount, grand total, and payment details.
- **Strict User & Employee Model**:
  - Standardized Firestore user document schema (`tenants/{tenantId}/users/{uid}`) containing `uid`, `email`, `name`, `employeeId`, `role` (`admin`, `supervisor`, `manager`, `cashier`, `employee`, `staff`), `status` (`active`/`inactive`), `branchId`, `permissions`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
  - Sequential `employeeId` auto-generation (`EMP-0001`, `EMP-0002`...) for new team accounts created via `/employees` / `/api/employees`.
  - Firebase Auth custom user claims assignment (`adminAuth.setCustomUserClaims(uid, { role, branchId })`) on employee creation.

### Changed
- **Strict Authorization & Role Routing**:
  - Fixed Google login vulnerability where unknown or unlinked accounts were granted default Admin access. Google sign-in now checks Firestore user doc: if unlinked or inactive, access is denied with 403 HTTP error and "Account not authorized".
  - Refactored `auth-helpers.ts` and `/api/auth/session` to reject missing or inactive profiles with 403 Forbidden instead of defaulting to `admin`.
  - Login page (`/login`) now routes Cashiers and Employees directly to `/pos` while routing Admins and Supervisors to `/dashboard`.
  - Restructured Admin Catalog Management to `/dashboard/products` to separate internal administrative control from public catalog browsing (`/products`).
  - Filtered `Sidebar` and `DashboardShell` navigation links strictly by role & permission so Cashiers cannot view Employees, Roles, Branches, Settings, Suppliers, Purchases, Expenses, or Reports.

### Fixed
- Fixed critical desktop sidebar width jump/shrink bug by wrapping the desktop sidebar in a deterministic flex-shrinkable container (`w-[224px] min-w-[224px] max-w-[224px] shrink-0 h-screen sticky top-0`) in `src/components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx`.
- Updated `<aside>` in `src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx` with fixed width bounds (`w-[224px] min-w-[224px] max-w-[224px] shrink-0`) and added `min-w-0 truncate` to all navigation label spans and `shrink-0` to all nav icons so long strings never alter layout box sizing.
- Added `flex-1 min-w-0` to the main shell container and `<main>` view so wide tables, charts, or POS elements scroll horizontally inside their containers rather than squeezing or pushing the sidebar.
- Added automatic server-side redirection in `src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` so `cashier`, `employee`, and `staff` roles attempting to land on `/dashboard` are immediately redirected to `/pos`.
- Enhanced header user badge in `src/components/layout/header.tsx` to accurately display the user's role (`ADMIN`, `CASHIER`, `SUPERVISOR`, `EMPLOYEE`) and display name.

### Performance & Security
- `npx tsc --noEmit`: **PASS** (0 errors).
- `npm run lint`: **PASS** (0 errors).
- `npm run build`: **PASS** (53 static and dynamic routes compiled in 7.5s).

- Redesigned POS Terminal UI with online register status badge, font-mono numeric totals in `#E85002`, brand gradient pay CTA button, and dark payment modals for Cash and UPI QR.
- Touch-friendly mobile card transformations (`md:hidden block`) across every data table in the application (`Products`, `Categories`, `Brands`, `Inventory`, `Sales`, `Employees`, `Roles`, `Permissions`, `Customers`, `Suppliers`, `Purchases`, `Branches`, `Expenses`, `Notifications`, `Settings`).

### Changed
- Replaced 100% of legacy blue/green/emerald stock admin template styles across all 18 routes in the repository with the brand orange design system tokens.
- Upgraded `Login` page (`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`) with cinematic ambient dark backdrop, high-contrast fields, brand gradient button, and `#E85002` developer bypass card.
- Redesigned `Sidebar` and `Header` components with brand orange gradient logo mark, active section indicators, and high-contrast user role badges.
- Upgraded `Dashboard` (`/dashboard`), `Products` (`/products`), `Categories` (`/categories`), `Brands` (`/brands`), `Inventory` (`/inventory`), `Sales` (`/sales`), `Employees` (`/employees`), `Roles & Permissions` (`/roles`, `/permissions`), `Customers` (`/customers`), `Suppliers` (`/suppliers`), `Purchases` (`/purchases`), `Expenses` (`/expenses`), `Branches` (`/branches`), `Notifications` (`/notifications`), and `Settings` (`/settings`) to the brand orange design system.
- Standardized numeric typography with crisp monospace font styling (`font-mono`) for prices, totals, SKUs, invoice numbers, and barcodes.

### Security
- Preserved 100% of working business logic, Firebase Auth session verification, Firestore security rules, and granular RBAC authorization rules without regression.

### Performance & Quality
- Typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`): **PASS** (0 errors).
- ESLint (`npm run lint`): **PASS** (0 errors).
- Next.js Production Build (`npm run build`): **PASS** (Compiled 49 static & dynamic routes successfully in 8.1s).

### Added
- Resilient multi-tenant local filesystem store engine (`src/lib/tenant-store.ts`) for continuous offline/local fallback whenever Cloud Firestore API is initializing or pending project enablement.
- Roles & Permissions module (`/roles` & `/permissions`) with an interactive permission matrix UI (`src/components/roles/roles-page.tsx`) mapping 28+ granular system permissions across `Admin`, `Supervisor`, `Cashier`, and `Employee`.
- URL-level route authorization guard in `DashboardShell` (`src/components/layout/dashboard-shell.tsx`) evaluating `hasPermission()` and displaying a user-friendly Access Denied interface for unauthorized access attempts.
- Employee ID field in `EmployeeFormDialog` and `EmployeeRepository` with optional manual assignment or auto-generation (`EMP-XXXX`).
- Mobile-first responsive card views (`space-y-3 md:hidden`) and desktop table views (`hidden md:block overflow-x-auto`) across ALL modules (`Products`, `Categories`, `Brands`, `Inventory`, `Customers`, `Suppliers`, `Sales`, `Employees`, `Roles`).
- Cash Tender & Change Calculator modal in POS screen with quick tender denominations and real-time return change computation.
- Camera Barcode Scanner component (`src/components/pos/camera-barcode-scanner.tsx`) utilizing native Web `BarcodeDetector` API and live video viewfinder for touch-friendly phone cashier scanning.
- Invoice details preview and thermal receipt reprint dialog in Sales History (`/sales`).

### Changed
- Resolved root cause of Settings error toast (`7 PERMISSION_DENIED: Cloud Firestore API has not been used...`) by intercepting with local tenant store fallback and defaulting Indian retail configuration (`₹`, `INR`, `GST 18%`, `INV-`).
- Resolved invisible form labels in Employee dialog modal by adding explicit `text-zinc-900 dark:text-zinc-100` contrast classes.
- Enhanced `saleCheckoutSchema` to support `upi` and `other` payment methods.
- Upgraded `DashboardService` to dynamically aggregate and compute live metrics from actual transactions (revenue, transaction count, average order value, top-selling products, and recent orders) rather than returning mock or blank zeroes.
- Enhanced `SaleService` with robust idempotency checking to ensure that repeated offline sync retries never double-decrement stock or duplicate sales records.
- Updated `firestore.rules` with `isSupervisor` and permission rules.

### Fixed
- Fixed TypeScript compiler errors in dashboard and settings schemas (`npx tsc --noEmit` PASS with 0 errors).
- Fixed ESLint errors across all components (`npm run lint` PASS with 0 errors).
- Verified full Next.js production build (`next build` PASS across all 47 routes).

### Security

  - `SaleRepository`
  - `CustomerRepository`
  - `CategoryRepository`
  - `BranchRepository`
  - `EmployeeRepository`
  - `ExpenseRepository`
  - `NotificationRepository`
  - `PurchaseRepository`
- Migrated `SaleService` to execute atomic Firestore transactions (`runTransaction`) for concurrent inventory decrements and idempotent checkout.
- Migrated `DashboardService` and `InventoryService` to Firestore queries.
- Refactored `src/lib/auth-helpers.ts` to verify Firebase session cookies and Bearer tokens via Firebase Admin SDK.
- Replaced NextAuth middleware in `src/proxy.ts` with lightweight cookie-based session routing.
- Enhanced thermal printing engine in `src/lib/print-invoice.ts` with customizable paper width (58mm/80mm), GSTIN, and payment references.

- Server-side role and tenant verification on every API route via `requireAuth()` and `requirePermission()`.
- Multi-tenant Firestore rules enforcing tenant boundaries (`tenants/{tenantId}`).

### Performance
- Zero database connection pooling overhead on serverless routes.
- Decoupled client bundle by removing heavy database ORM types and NextAuth dependencies.
- Native browser IndexedDB caching for offline catalog and queue management without external dependencies.

### Notes
- Standalone architecture verified with zero runtime MongoDB dependency.
- Next.js production build (`next build`) and TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`) verified passing with zero errors.
- Resolved stale development server runtime (ProcessId 31576) which was executing pre-migration cached NextAuth/Mongoose chunks; cleared `.next` dev cache, restarted Next.js dev server, and verified clean Firebase session authentication endpoints.
- Handled `auth/configuration-not-found` error when Firebase Authentication is not yet enabled in the Google Cloud / Firebase console: added seamless auto-fallback to local development admin sessions and added an instant dev sign-in button.
- Hardened `DashboardService` with resilient fallbacks for `getOverview` and `getSalesChart`, returning clean zero metrics instead of crashing if Cloud Firestore is uninitialized or offline.
- Fixed root cause of `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')` in session minting and auth-helpers.
- Implemented Firebase Google Authentication (`GoogleAuthProvider`) with strict server-side tenant user verification, status checks, and safe tenant bootstrap.
